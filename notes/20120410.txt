CRC Cards
  Characterize objects by...
    - Class name
    - Responsibilities
    - Collaborators

"...give up the global knowledge of control...Novice designs are littered with regressions to global thinking: global variables, unnecessary pointers, ..."
  /* hmmm...IoC...I'm looking at you */

"The Class Name of an object creates a vocabulary for discussing a design"

"Responsibilities identify the problems to be solved"
  "The responsibilities of an object are expressed by a handful of short verb phrases, each containing an active verb"

"...Collaborators objects which will send or be sent messages in the course of satisfying responsibilities"
  "No Object is an Island"
  /* "Collaboration is not necessarily a symetric relationship...", I thought this an astute observation */

CRC cards
  /* Portability and System Independence are properties...I found this funny, for some reason. */

"...design of the cards tends to progress from knows to unknowns..."

"Ragu Raghavan has said that in the switch to objects strong programmers become stronger, but weaker programmers are left behind."
  /* Hmm.  There's something about this statement that bugs me, but I can't put my finger on it.  Are we sure the "weak" are "weak", or would they rather be Functional? */

/* I love the observation the author makes that the physical cards make the people involved in the process more invested in it somehow */

Done
